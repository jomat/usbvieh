Lets you switch the USB mode of your N900 between ethernet and storage mode.
You can choose between different image files or cd iso images i. e. to be able
to install different operating systems without the need to carrying a bunch of
USB sticks with you.


Usage:
- Create a folder /home/user/MyDocs/usbvieh and put your image files / iso images
  or symlinks to them into it.
- start the usbvieh
- choose some files and add them with +
- choose:
  - click "file" to make them accessible via usb
  - click "ether" to have usb networking


Installation:
touch /etc/modprobe.d/g_file_storage
chown user /etc/modprobe.d/g_file_storage

ensure that user is allowed to sudo modprobe g_file_storage file=... and sudo modprobe g_ether (should be enabled by default)

get rid of:  892 haldaemo  3084 S    {hald-addon-usb-} hald-addon-usb-cable: listening on /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/usb1/../mode
# chmod -x /usr/lib/hal/hald-addon-usb-cable
add to /etc/event.d/rcS-late at the right place:
    mount /home/user/MyDocs/

prevent automatic loading of g_nokia:
comment out g_file_storage and g_nokia in these files: grep -r "g_file_storage\|g_nokia" /etc/ to prevent automatic loading of them, as I had trouble removing g_nokia
